Thanks for checking out.

I build my first react based website with using API.

Users be able to:

- Search any movie.
- Shows the movies title,release date, rating,cast.
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.


**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
